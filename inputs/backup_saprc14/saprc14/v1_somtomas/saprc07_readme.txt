File  		Date  	Mechanism Version
SAPRC07B.RXN	1/25/10 	Standard version of the SAPRC-07 mechanism as documented in the CARB report, using chemical operators for peroxy radicals to reduce the number of reactions (CMAQ version is not compatible with the current versions of the CMAQ chemical compiler)
SAPRC07C.RXN	1/25/10 	The "expanded" version of the above mechanism. Same chemistry, predictions and emissions assignments as SAPRC07B.MEC, and SAPRC07B.RXN, but uses additional reactions for the peroxy radicals so that the .MEC version is compatible with current versions of CMAQ chemical compilers.
SAPRC07A.RXN	1/25/10		The version of SAPRC-07 that uses the condensed peroxy radical operator representation as used in SAPRC-99. Discussed in the report documenting the condensed SAPRC-07 mechanisms. (See also the main SAPRC mechanism web page.)
S07TB.RXN	1/25/10 	"Toxics" version of SAPRC-07, with additional model species to explicitly represent selected toxics species. This is referred to as "SAPRC07T" in the emissions assignment files. This version uses chemical operators for peroxy radicals to reduce the number of reactions (.MEC not compatible with current versions of CMAQ chemical compiler) (Revised 4/8/09)
S07TC.RXN	1/25/10 	The "expanded" version of the above mechanism. Same chemistry, predictions and emissions assignments as S07TB.MEC, but uses additional reactions for the peroxy radicals so it is compatible with current versions of CMAQ chemical compilers.
CS07A.RXN	1/52/10 	The standard condensed SAPRC-07 mechanism using the SAPRC-99 peroxy radical representation. This is the most condensed version considered appropriate for airshed model calculations. Discussed in the report documenting the condensed SAPRC-07 mechanisms. (See also the main SAPRC mechanism web page.)
CS07B.RXN	1/25/10 	The version of the condensed SAPRC-07 mechanism that uses the more detailed SAPRC-07 peroxy radical representation. This may be more appropriate for applications requiring better hydroperoxide predictions. Discussed in the report documenting the condensed SAPRC-07 mechanisms. (See also the main SAPRC mechanism web page.)
